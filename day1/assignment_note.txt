Features Of Python
---------------------------
• Interpreted Language
	 Python is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line by line, which simplifies debugging
	 and development.
	 
• Object-Oriented Language
	Python is also an objectoriented language since its beginning. It allows us to develop applications using an
	Object-Oriented approach. 
	Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below.
	 Class
	 Object
	 Method
	 Inheritance
	 Polymorphism
	 Data Abstraction
	 Encapsulation

• Open-Source Language
	 Python is free to use and distribute. Its source code is publicly available,
	 which encourages community contributions and allows anyone to modify and improve the language.

• Strong Support for Integration
	 Python integrates well with other languages and tools, which makes it suitable for various applications such as
	 web services, enterprise applications, and more. It also supports integration with C, C++, and Java.
	 
• Learn Standard Library
	 Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides many built-in modules and functions for common tasks
	 like file handling, network programming, and data manipulation, which simplifies coding.
	
• Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks
	 Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various purposes, such as web development (Django, Flask),
	 data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), machine learning (TensorFlow, scikit-learn), and more,
	 making it versatile for many applications.

•  Readable and Maintainable Code
	 The emphasis on readability in Python’s design philosophy helps developers
	 write clean and maintainable code. The use of whitespace and indentation enforces a clean coding structure.
